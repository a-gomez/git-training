Follow these steps to create your own training repository:

$ mkdir git-training
$ cd git-training
$ git init

Create a readme file for the project, and add it to git

$ vim README
$ git commit -a -m "started describing setup process"  # this could be done into 2 steps
$ git log  
$ gitk &  # the ampersand creates a separate process

We're working in the dev branch, which was created and switched to like so:
$ git branch  # lists branchs
$ git branch dev  # creates a 'dev' branch
$ git checkout dev   # switches to this branch
$ vim README

And remember to commit your changes:
$ git commit -a -m 'added instructions for creating and switching branches'
